        "description": "I'm a creative developer who believes in the power of clean code and beautiful design. With expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks and a keen eye for user experience, I build applications that not only work flawlessly but also delight users.\n\nMy journey in tech started when I built my first website at 15, and since then, I've been hooked on creating digital experiences that make a difference. I specialize in React, Node.js and Kotlin.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me sleeping and chilling while watching some good movie or web series or might be listening to some good music on my headphones.",
